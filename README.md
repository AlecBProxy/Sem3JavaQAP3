# NOTE
Each Java class is labeled with the problem that is being solved with the particular class.
(ex: Student.Java is for Problem #1)

In the case of classes such as Triangle.java, they are part of the solution for both problems #3, and #4.

## The test classes are as followsâ€¦

- Demo.java (Problem #1)
- PointDemo.java (Problem #2)
- ShapeDemo.java (Problem #3)
- ScalableDemo.java (Problem #4)
